Guess the Number - Game Rules
Objective:
The goal of the game is to guess a secret number between 1 and 100 that the computer has randomly chosen.

How to Play:
Make a Guess: You will start the game by entering a number between 1 and 100 in the input field and clicking "Submit Guess."
Receive Feedback: After each guess, the game will tell you whether your guess is:
Too Low: Your guess is lower than the secret number.
Too High: Your guess is higher than the secret number.
Correct: You've guessed the secret number correctly, and the game will tell you how many attempts it took.
Keep Trying: If your guess was too high or too low, simply enter a new guess and submit it again.
Winning: Once you guess the correct number, the game will congratulate you and show the number of attempts it took. Afterward, the game will reset and you can start over.

Each time you guess the correct number, the game resets automatically, and a new random number is chosen. You can start playing again with a fresh secret number.
